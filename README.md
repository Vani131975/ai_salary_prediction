# ai_salary_prediction

##  What I Did

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed salary distributions, experience levels, job locations, and remote work trends  
   - Visualized relationships between salary and features like company size, skills, and geography

2.  **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers  
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., experience level, employment type)  
   - Normalized numerical features for model compatibility

3.  **ANN Model Building**  
   - Built an Artificial Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras  
   - Defined input layers, hidden layers, activation functions, and output node for regression

4.  **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Split data into training and test sets  
   - Trained the model and evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and R¬≤ metrics

5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   - Tuned batch size, epochs, learning rate, and number of layers to improve accuracy  
   - Used GridSearch-like approach and monitored validation loss

6.  **Final Report & Explanation**  
   - Documented model performance and feature importance  
   - Interpreted the results in the context of global AI job trends  
   - Provided insights and recommendations based on findings
